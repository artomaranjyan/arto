<!-- I am contributing to the foundations of ML. (Start with what result I do...)-->

I'm a PhD student at KAUST, working under the guidance of [Prof. Peter Richt√°rik](https://richtarik.org/i_bio.html).
My research focuses on optimization for machine learning and federated learning, where I contribute to the development of distributed and randomized optimization algorithms.


Before starting my PhD, I earned my MSc and BSc from Yerevan State University. 
During my bachelor's studies, I coauthored several papers in Harmonic Analysis under the supervision of [Prof. Martin Grigoryan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=l-2JIPkAAAAJ&hl=en).


Outside of academics, I enjoy dancing bachata, playing board games, ultimate frisbee and foosball.
