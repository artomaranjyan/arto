I'm a PhD student in Computer Science at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, working under the guidance of [Peter Richt√°rik](https://richtarik.org/i_bio.html). 
My focus is on optimization theory and its applications in Machine Learning.

Apart from my studies, I have a keen interest in Harmonic Analysis. 
This interest started during my final year of bachelor's studies, where I've been collaborating with my Bachelor's thesis supervisor, [Martin Grigoryan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=l-2JIPkAAAAJ&hl=en).

Outside of academics, I enjoy dancing (bachata, salsa), playing board games, ultimate frisbee, climbing, and foosball.
